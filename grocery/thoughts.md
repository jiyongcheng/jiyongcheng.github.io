### Tech
1. If I want to know the actual test coverage report for one specific endpoint, could I change the coverage color to blue for example.
2. I could create a android app which send pictures or moments to different social media like twitter, wechat, facebook etc. I could edit the pictures or words on the app, afterwards using the api to send them to all platform.
3. I wonder could I use text content in the Swipe js.
