The company chose to change the websiteâ€™s technical framework from .NET to PHP.
This project is for changing the existing pages from using .Net to PHP (Symfony 3). We chose to use Symfony framework because it is a robust and mature PHP framework. It has been around since 2005 and has a strong developer community and ecosystem supporting it.</description></item></channel></rss>
