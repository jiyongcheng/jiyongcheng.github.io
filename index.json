Instead, the filter is run once using null as the input. This is useful when using jq as a simple calculator or to construct JSON data from scratch.\n  input and inputs, that read from the same sources (e.g., stdin, files named on the command-line) as jq itself.\n input Outputs one new input. inputs Outputs all remaining inputs, one by one.    Explaination of the process   -R means jq will treat the anything it gets as a string not a JSON. if you don\u0026rsquo;t use -R and pass a string as input, it will throw error.\n  -n means jq will not read any input. so it can work together with inputs to construct a JSON data.\n if you do this echo '1\\n2\\n3' | jq -R '[inputs]' you will only get [\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;3\u0026quot;]. why? because without -n jq will read a input, which is 1, then the inputs will ouputs the remaining inputs, which are 2\\n3. if you do this echo '1\\n2\\n3' | jq -Rn '[inputs]', you will get [\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;3\u0026quot;]. why? because with -n jq will not read a input, so the inputs will outputs the remaining inputs, which are 1\\n2\\n3.    select(length\u0026gt;0) for each input, it will filter out the empty input\n  assemble_user(.) for each input, it will call the def assemble_user\n  def assemble_user($user_id): {\u0026quot;user_id\u0026quot;: $user_id} for each input like 123, it will return a object like {\u0026quot;user_id\u0026quot;: 123}\n  \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; this symbol means Here string\n \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; is known as here-string. Instead of typing in text, you give a pre-made string of text to a program. For example, with such program as bc we can do bc \u0026laquo;\u0026lt; 54 to just get output for that specific case, no need to run bc interactively. Think of it as the equivalent of echo \u0026lsquo;54\u0026rsquo; | bc.  check the difference between \u0026lt;,\u0026lt;\u0026lt;,\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; here\n  --argjson means it has a JSON data as the argument.\n  --arg means it has a string data as the argument\n  jq -n --argjson user_ids \u0026quot;$USER_IDS\u0026quot; --arg organisation_id \u0026quot;$ORGANISATION_ID\u0026quot;  you can structure a JSON data easily.\n  The result  So first step I get the array with objects.  if you do this quickly    echo \u0026#39;2f9921bc-a4c9-419a-b069-f8f23c7727f7\\n26bf5cc3-73de-425e-9a6b-b70223387314\\n30ac5b4c-f4c6-42c6-901d-e8bdf16464b8\u0026#39; | jq -Rn \u0026#39; def assemble_users($user_id): {\u0026#34;user_id\u0026#34;: $user_id}; [ inputs | select(length\u0026gt;0) | assemble_users(.) ]\u0026#39; you will get:\n[ { \u0026#34;user_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2f9921bc-a4c9-419a-b069-f8f23c7727f7\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;user_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;26bf5cc3-73de-425e-9a6b-b70223387314\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;user_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;30ac5b4c-f4c6-42c6-901d-e8bdf16464b8\u0026#34; } ]  Second, I assemble them together as a object. you will get  { \u0026#34;users\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;user_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2f9921bc-a4c9-419a-b069-f8f23c7727f7\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;user_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;26bf5cc3-73de-425e-9a6b-b70223387314\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;user_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;30ac5b4c-f4c6-42c6-901d-e8bdf16464b8\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;organisation_id\u0026#34;: 123, \u0026#34;user-type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; } ","permalink":"https://jiyongcheng.dev/post/create-array-with-object-from-list/","tags":["jq"],"title":"Create Array With Object From List using jq"},{"categories":["Programming Language"],"contents":"The question I have I was reading this article \u0026ldquo;PHP Serialization, Stack Traces, and Exceptions\u0026rdquo;[^1] and had these questions:\n Why PDO isn\u0026rsquo;t serializable? Why isn\u0026rsquo;t every type of object serializable?  The answer After some search, I found some useful information as follows. check this for details\n A PDO object contains state that cannot be represented in the serialization format. For example, the PDO object contains an open connection to a database server.\n And I copied the answer from here:\nSome objects encapsulate resources like file pointers or network sockets that can\u0026rsquo;t be deserialized to the state they were in when you serialized the object that contained them.\nExample: you shouldn't deserialize an object that serves as an authenticated database connection, because to do so, you'd need the serialized form to contain a plaintext password. This would not be a good practice, because someone might get a hold of the saved serialized form. You also have no idea when you deserialize that the database server is still running, can be accessed, the authentication credentials still valid, etc.  Why the test written by the author can work Test code is here:\nclass NotSerializable implements Serializable { public function serialize() { throw new LogicException(\u0026#39;You cannot serialize or unserialize NotSerializable instances\u0026#39;); } public function unserialize($serialized) { throw new LogicException(\u0026#39;You cannot serialize or unserialize NotSerializable instances\u0026#39;); } } If you write a test code like this:\n$a = new NotSerializable(); echo serialize($a); It will throw the error:\nPHP Fatal error: Uncaught LogicException: You cannot serialize or unserialize NotSerializable instances in /home/jdoodle.php:7 Stack trace: #0 [internal function]: NotSerializable-\u0026gt;serialize() #1 /home/jdoodle.php(23): serialize(Object(NotSerializable)) #2 {main}  thrown in /home/jdoodle.php on line 7 Command exited with non-zero status 255 My understanding Because the serialize() function should return string or null to represent the object\u0026rsquo;s state, but it throws an Exception which isn\u0026rsquo;t it\u0026rsquo;s state.

I saw in a PHP class using this method __invoke\npublic function __invoke(int $errorNumber, string $errorString, string $errorFile, int $errorLine): bool { ... } Why using this method? This magic method is called when user tries to invoke object as a function. Possible use cases may include some approaches like functional programming or some callbacks.\nHow do people use it? class Invokable { /** * This method will be called if object will be executed like a function: * * $invokable(); * * Args will be passed as in regular method call. */ public function __invoke($arg, $arg, ...) { print_r(func_get_args()); } } // Example: $invokable = new Invokable(); $invokable([1, 2, 3]); // optputs: Array ( [0] =\u0026gt; 1 [1] =\u0026gt; 2 [2] =\u0026gt; 3 ) ","permalink":"https://jiyongcheng.dev/post/php-magic-method-invoke/","tags":["PHP","magic method"],"title":"PHP Magic Method Invoke"},{"categories":["Web Development"],"contents":"Issue found: I found the post which has code block cannot render correctly in the small devices which width is less than 576px.\nWhy?
