### Bush fires

The bush fires are still going on which have destoried many houses.

### Matthew 21:41
> “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.”

I get the title from this verse, because in this story there are two kinds tenants, one is evil who were not willing to give the share, even though, they want to occupy the property. The other one kind tenants are good ones who will give the share at harvest time.

I think harvest time is a period of time of our life. God has given us maybe people to look after, time to use, intellegence to help. Let's take time as a example, have us used our time with correct responsibility? because the time is given by God to us, and He expected some share from us.

Maybe we want all the time belong to us, watching TV, enjoying the time on the phone, playing video games, have fun with people. But we didn't spent time with God, with the people we should. In which case like the evil tenant who doesn't want to give it to the owner, and Maybe they don't want others to have time with God either.
